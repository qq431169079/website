Sometimes you need to browse a site from a different location but deploying a proxy can take a while to set up and sometimes you just need a throw away proxy for checking something.

I have a nice easy way to do this...

go to <a href="https://dply.co">https://dply.co</a> and create a VPS in a location you need.

use this gist of commands and you should be good to go.remember to change the username from foo and the password from bar and you're sorted.
