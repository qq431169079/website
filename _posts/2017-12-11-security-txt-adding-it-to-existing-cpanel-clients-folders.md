<p style="text-align: left;">After reading a few tweets i've seen a really good idea.

basically adding a security.txt file to your root WWW directory to allow people to report security issues with your website and give them a link to your public PGP key and also a link to your little hall of fame.

I run a Cpanel server in work and we have around 80 clients so I had to add this to all of their websites.

I added the file's needed to the skeleton pageÂ /root/cpanel3-skel/public_html/ but I needed to add it to every client website.

How to add it to all current users websites:
