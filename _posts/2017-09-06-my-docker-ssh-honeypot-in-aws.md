So the other day I decided to try make a honeypot using docker and found a great little projectÂ <a href="https://github.com/droberson/ssh-honeypot">https://github.com/droberson/ssh-honeypot</a>

The final version of the SSH honeypot was this..
<a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/txt3rob/docker-ssh-honey/">https://hub.docker.com/r/txt3rob/docker-ssh-honey/</a>

So I fired it up in shipyard (nice web gui for docker) and put this in AWS on the free tier to test.

The results after 20 hours so far are!
